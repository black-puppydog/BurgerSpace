2010-03-30: BurgerSpace 1.8.4 released.

    Game now pauses automatically when window loses focus.
    Fixed compilation warnings.

2009-02-26: BurgerSpace 1.8.3 released.

    Pressing Escape key to quit now brings up a confirmation dialog.

    Various fixes to compile under GCC 4.3.

    The XPM files now define "const" character arrays.

2007-12-22: BurgerSpace 1.8.2 released.

    Games can be saved and loaded.  This code is experimental.

    More corner turn tolerance.  (See CORNER_TURN_TOLERANCE in
    src/BurgerSpaceEngine.cpp.)

    Updated the GPLv2 `COPYING' file to reflect new FSF address.

2004-05-02: BurgerSpace 1.8.1 released.

    Links with flatzebra 0.1.1.

2003-06-02: BurgerSpace 1.8.0 released.

    Adapted to the flatzebra library, the successor of gengameng.
    New option --z-for-pepper to use the Z key to shoot pepper
    instead of the Ctrl key.
    New .desktop file now always installed, and adapted to
    Desktop Menu Specification.
    Autoconf macro used to avoid GNU getopt code when compiling on
    BSD-like systems.
    When the sound device is not available, the program does not quit.
    When a game ends, the last level played remains displayed.

2003-01-22: BurgerSpace 1.7.1 released.

    When requested direction is impossible, last moving direction is
    attempted.  This can be useful to turn corners automatically.

2003-01-11: BurgerSpace 1.7.0 released.

    Disappointingly stupid sound effects added.
    Burger ingredients fall twice as fast, which imitates BurgerTime
    more closely.
    Makefiles cleaned up.

2002-04-03: BurgerSpace 1.6.1 released.

    Adaptation to gengameng 4.1.
    Contact email address removed from sources.

2001-11-25: BurgerSpace 1.6 released.

    Compatible with gengameng 4.0.

    Superfluous inclusion of <X11/keysym.h> now eliminated.

    ./configure script now has new option --with-gnome-desktop
    entry (or --without-gnome-desktop-entry) to decide if the
    installation adds a GNOME .desktop file and a PNG icon file to
    make BurgerSpace appear in the GNOME Games menu.  Default is
    to add the files.

    ./configure script also has new option --with-cxx to specify
    the executable program to use as the C++ compiler.  Useful
    when two versions of g++ (e.g., 2.95.2 and 3.0) cohabitate
    on a system.

2001-04-27: BurgerSpace 1.5 released

    This version uses gengameng 3.0, which is based on SDL
    (http://www.libsdl.org/).  A Windows version is available.

2001-03-30: BurgerSpace 1.4 released

    The signature of the onTimeOut() function in src/xtmain.cc
    has been corrected so that the file compiles on a RedHat 7.0
    system.  It should not have compiled on my RedHat 6.2 system,
    because the type of the function was not compatible in
    principle with XtAppAddTimeOut().  Strangely, NeedFunctionPrototypes
    is defined when X11/Intrinsic.h is read by g++ (2.95.2 in my case),
    so the compiler should have seen the type mismatch.
    RedHat 7.0 uses g++ 2.96, so perhaps that makes the difference.

    The FocusIn and FocusOut events are now used to turn the keyboard
    auto-repeat off and on.  Version 1.3 of BurgerSpace used the
    EnterNotify and LeaveNotify (EnterWindowMask and LeaveWindowMask)
    events instead of FocusIn and FocusOut (FocusChangeMask).
    This caused inappropriate behavior.

2001-03-23: BurgerSpace 1.3 released

    The XtNinput resource is explicitly set to true in the call
    to XtVaAppInitialize() in src/xtmain.cc.  This makes sure that
    the application request the focus from the window manager.

    Thanks to David Nusinow for this patch.

2001-01-13: BurgerSpace 1.2 released

    Version 1.2 uses gengameng 2.0, which avoids polling the keyboard
    with XQueryKeymap() and expects instead to be informed of key
    state changes upon KeyPress and KeyRelease events.  See xtmain.cc
    for an example of how to get those events and how to transmit
    the information to the game engine.

    This change seems to solve some of the problems of people who
    reported that the game did not receive any keyboard input.
    However, there are still reports of similar problems.
