.SH NAME
@PACKAGE@ \- @PACKAGE_SUMMARY_EN@
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B @PACKAGE@
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fB@PACKAGE_FULL_NAME@\fR
is a game where you are a chef and you must walk over hamburger
ingredients (buns, meat, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese) to make them fall
from floor to floor, until they end up in the plates at the bottom of
the screen.
Use the 
\fBarrow keys\fR
to move the chef.
.PP
However, you must do this while avoiding terrible enemies,
such as eggs, sausages and pickles.  You will die if
they touch you, but you can spray pepper on them with the
\fBControl key\fR
to paralyze them temporarily.
.PP
Use those pepper shots sparingly because you only
have a limited number of them.  Pick up the treat that appears
from time to time to obtain a new pepper shot.
.PP
A two-player game is possible using the (experimental)
networked version of @PACKAGE_FULL_NAME@.
See the @PACKAGE@-server(6) manual page or
the @PACKAGE_FULL_NAME@ Home Page for details.
.PP
Use the \fBEscape key\fR to quit the program.
To pause the game (which is only possible in stand-alone mode),
use the \fBP key\fR to pause the game and to resume it afterwards.
