.SH NAME
@PACKAGE@-server \- UDP server for the networked version of @PACKAGE_FULL_NAME@
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B @PACKAGE@-server
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fB@PACKAGE@-server\fR
is a server that accepts connections from @PACKAGE_FULL_NAME@ clients 
to allow two players to compete with each other. One player controls the
chef and the other controls the egg. Other clients can connect as
spectators.
.PP
@PACKAGE@-server should be started in a terminal. To terminate it,
give the Ctrl-C sequence or use the kill(1) command with the server's
process ID as the argument.
.PP
The connections use the UDP protocol. The \fB--port\fR option can be
used to specify a non-default listening port (see below).
.PP
After the server has started, the user who wants to control the chef
must start the client with this command:
.PP
@PACKAGE@ --server=the.server.hostname.com --chef
.PP
Use the appropriate hostname or IP address as the argument for --server.
The user who wants to control the egg must give the --enemy option instead
of --chef.
The --port option can be added to the @PACKAGE@ command-line to specify
the server port, if the server was started with a non-default UDP listening
port.
.PP
